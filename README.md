### Project Overview

This project is a Geography trivia game built with React for the front end and Node.js for the back end. It follows a _Who Wants to Be a Millionaire_ theme: you earn money by correctly answering questions, lose immediately when you answer incorrectly or the time runs out, and you can use two types of hints.

### How to Run the Program

Clone the repository: `git clone [repository-url]`. Start the backend server by running `geckpot\api\app.js`, then start the front end by going to the `geckpot\front_end` directory and typing `npm start`.

### Dependencies

You need to have __Node.js__ and __npm__ installed. You can download both from the official website: https://nodejs.org.

- Recommended Node.js Version: 18.x.x (LTS)

To install the dependencies, run the following command in both the frontend and backend directories:

`npm install`
