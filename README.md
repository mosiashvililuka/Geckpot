### Project Overview

This project is a Geography trivia game built with React for the front end and Node.js for the back end. It has a Who Wants to Be a Millionaire theme: you earn money by correctly answering, lost immediately when you answer incorrectly or time runs out, and you can use two types of hints.

### Reflection

While working on this application, I learned a lot about web development and JavaScript. I did not have any background in those, and it was a rewarding challenge to experiment with different things and learn by doing. I planned to expand the project significantly. I wanted to add a main menu and options pages, where users could change settings, like using a cheat mode, disabling sound, etc, but I did not have enough time.

### How to Run the Program

Clone the repository: `git clone [repository-url]`. Start the backend server by running `geckpot\api\app.js`, then start the front end by going to the `geckpot\api\front_end directory` and then writing `npm start`

### Dependencies
This project requires the following dependencies:

#### Frontend (React)

- react: The core library for building the user interface.
- react-dom: Required for rendering React components.
- axios: For making HTTP requests to the backend.
- Backend (Node.js)
- express: The framework for building the server.
- body-parser: Middleware for parsing incoming request bodies.
- cors: Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
- axios: Used for making HTTP requests to external APIs.

To install the dependencies, run the following command in both the frontend and backend directories:

`npm install`
