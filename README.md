### Project Overview

This project is a Geography trivia game built with React for the front end and Node.js for the back end. It has a Who Wants to Be a Millionaire theme: you earn money by correctly answering, lost immediately when you answer incorrectly or time runs out, and you can use two types of hints.

### Reflection

While working on this application, I learned a lot about web development and JavaScript. I did not have any background in those, and it was a rewarding challenge to experiment with different things and learn by doing. I planned to expand the project significantly. I wanted to add a main menu and options pages, where users could change settings, like using a cheat mode, disabling sound, etc.
